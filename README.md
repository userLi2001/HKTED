# HKTED
This is the implementation of the paper "Hierarchical Knowledge Transferability via Denoising Enhancement for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation".

You can implement our model according to the following steps:

1. The dataset should be put into ``src/Data/<dataset>``

```
The dataset can be obtained through this link: https://www.amazon.com
```

2. Install the necessary packages.
```
- Python 3.8
- Pytorch 2.1.0
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tqdm
```

4. Finally, you can run the following to test the augmention performance for HKTDE:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```
